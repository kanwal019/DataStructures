# DataStructures

A small collection of data structure implementations and experiments in C#.

## Contents
- Implementations: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables
- Examples: simple console programs demonstrating usage
- Tests: unit tests for core data structures (if present)

## Getting started (Windows)
1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
2. Build: `dotnet build`
3. Run a demo project: `dotnet run --project path\to\project.csproj`
4. Run tests: `dotnet test`

## Contributing
- Add implementations under appropriately named folders (e.g., LinkedList, BinaryTree).
- Add unit tests in a Tests project next to the implementation.
- Follow simple, well-documented commits and include examples for complex APIs.

## Notes
- This is a learning/research repository — expect simple, educational implementations rather than production-ready code.
- Feel free to open issues or create PRs for improvements.
